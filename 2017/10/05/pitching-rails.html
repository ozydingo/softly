<p>Making the case for Rails and ActiveRecord and for models-over-data to a hardcore SQL enthusiast</p>

<hr />

<p>When you spend a lot of time in Rails, it’s very easy to forget how much you take for granted. It’s also easy to forget how much you give up. Most of the time, you don’t miss much from the latter. To a developer who’s very fluent with raw SQL, Rails can often feel like way too much abstraction, and way too much magic. I get that. Magic is cool and all, but you lost an element of understanding and control. So I imagine a common question a lot of experienced developers seeing Rails for the first time ask themselves is “why should I learn this?”</p>

<p>In this post I hope to provide fodder to answer that question. This is a brief and by no means complete enumeration of ideas in this domain, but a hopefully digestable introduction.</p>

<h2 id="models-over-data">Models over data</h2>

<p>At the core of any web app, you want to deal with (read, write, and manipulate) data. <code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT * FROM widgets WHERE name = 'Best Widget'</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">INSERT INTO widgets (name, price) VALUES ('Totall Awesome Widget', 1000000)</code>. No problem. Ok, so you could do this with ActiveRecord too: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Widget.find_by(name: "Best Widget")</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Widget.create(name: "Totally Awesome Widget", price: 1_000_000)</code>. Different syntax, same functionality. If the readability doesn’t sell you, then what’s the big deal?</p>

<p>To me, most of the big deal comes with thinking about models over pure data. ActiveRecord is a powerful intersection between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a> and data persistence in a relational database. I’m not gonig to try to repeat the entire internet to make a case for object-oriented programming itself, but it is perhaps worth noting one or two bullet points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data is just data, instance of classes contain data and give you <em>behavior</em>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">widget = Widget.find(1)</code> therefore not only gives you the <em>data</em> in the row of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">widgets</code> table with id 1, but also gives you any consistent behavior you as the developer have written into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Widget</code> class. <code class="highlighter-rouge">widget.activate</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">widget.destroy</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">widget.compute_trajectory</code>. All of the methods (or functions, if you prefer) are now a developer-facing API to this object that encapsulates a single row of data in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">widgets</code> table.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to a logically organized set of behavior naturally associated with your data, here are a few of the things you unlock with this framing.</p>

<h3 id="1-callbacks">1. Callbacks</h3>

<p>While Rails has its very own seven layers of callback hell, when used properly they clean up a lot of code and can give you a very robust architecture. Let’s say our <code class="highlighter-rouge">widgets</code> table has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">price_updated_at</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">DATETIME</code> column. Keeping this data in sync always is as simple as:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Widget</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">before_save</span> <span class="ss">:check_for_price_update</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">check_for_price_update</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">price_updated_at</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">now</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">changes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:price</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now anyone*, anywhere*, who changes the price on a given row of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">widgets</code> table doesn’t even have to know about the existence of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">price_updated_at</code> data column – it gets updated correctly, and your data stay internally consistent.</p>

<p>* - The glaring exeptions, of course, are if you (1) use methods specifically designed to avoid callbacks (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">update_columns</code>), or (2) update the data using SQL or any other non-ActiveRecord-sanctioned method. It’s never impossible to do it the old fashioned way, but you shouldn’t have to if your models are well designed.</p>

<h3 id="2-abstraction">2. Abstraction</h3>

<p>Ruby often encourages you to forget about the specific of getter and setter methods, but in many an OOP class you’ll learn to define them with checks, validations, or other behaviors. Here’s a quick example, jumping right into ActiveRecord with an example where we want to encrypt a field before storing it in our database.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Widget</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
   <span class="c1"># setter</span>
   <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">secret</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">raw_secret</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="n">encrypted_secret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">AESCrypt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">raw_secret</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"sooper_secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">encrypted_secret</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="k">end</span>

   <span class="c1"># getter</span>
   <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">secret</span>
     <span class="no">AESEncrypt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">decrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">super</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"sooper_secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="k">end</span>
 <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ignoring how terribly unsecure this encryption is, the functioality is sublime. We simply interact with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">secret</code> field as if it were a normal, plain text field. Under the hood, our model now automatically encrypts (in the setter) and descrupt (in the getter) the value, so the plain text secret never touches the db.</p>

<p>This isn’t meant to be a primer on OOP, and of course anything you can think of doing with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> can be done here. Define methods that combine and manipulate data not stored directly on the table. Define procedures that do several complicated update steps. This is, of course, nothing you coudln’t do with an externally-defined class in any language which you can initialize with the data selected by raw SQL, but by representing the model backed by these data as a native, first-class citizen, you unlock a powerful level of fluency.</p>

<h3 id="3-dry-queries">3. DRY queries</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> code is maintainable code. I’ll let a small comparison speak for itself:</p>

<p>You can blow with this</p>
<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT * FROM widgets INNER JOIN creators ON creators.id = widgets.creator_id \
  INNER JOIN profiles ON creators.profile_id = profiles.id WHERE \
  widgets.available = 1 AND profiles.locale = 'us' \
  ORDER BY widgets.id DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT count(*) FROM widgets INNER JOIN creators ON creators.id = \
  widgets.creator_id INNER JOIN profiles ON creators.profile_id = \
  profiles.id WHERE widgets.available = 1 AND profiles.locale = 'us';
SELECT count(*) FROM widgets INNER JOIN creators ON creators.id = \
  widgets.creator_id INNER JOIN profiles ON creators.profile_id = \
  profiles.id WHERE widgets.available = 1 AND profiles.locale = 'us' \
  GROUP BY creators.name;
SELECT count(*) FROM widgets INNER JOIN creators ON creators.id = \
  widgets.creator_id INNER JOIN profiles ON creators.profile_id = profiles.id \
  WHERE widgets.available = 1 AND profiles.locale = 'us' AND widgets.price &lt; \
  1000 GROUP BY creators.name;
SELECT count(*) FROM widgets INNER JOIN creators ON creators.id = \
  widgets.creator_id INNER JOIN profiles ON creators.profile_id = \
  profiles.id WHERE widgets.available = 1 AND profiles.locale = 'us' AND \
  widgets.name = 'my_widget' GROUP BY creators.name;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can blow with that</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">creator_count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:creator_id</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">count</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">widgets</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">joins</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:creator</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">profile</span><span class="p">).</span>
  <span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">available: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">profiles: </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">locale: </span><span class="s1">'us'</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last</span>
<span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">count</span>
<span class="n">creator_count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">creator_count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"price &lt; 1000"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">creator_count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">name: </span><span class="s2">"my_widget"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These queries (here, the object represented by <code class="highlighter-rouge">widgets</code>) are themselves first-class citizens, members of the class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Widget::ActiveRecord_Relation</code>. You can pass these query objects into other methods and to other objects. You can build entire gems around manipulating these queries to some thematic end. With this native representation of the table rows or a query on these table rows as class instances, you can unleash a lot of functionality with very readable, maintainable, and slim code.</p>

<p>And with just a little extra Railsing, you could even blow with this:</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last</span>
<span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">count</span>
<span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">creator_count</span>
<span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">cheaper_than</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">creator_count</span>
<span class="no">Widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">named</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"my_widget"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">creator_count</span>
</code></pre>
